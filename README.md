# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the eligibility of individuals for obtaining a loan. The model uses a dataset of loan applicant's information, including various features such as income, credit history, employment details, and loan amount, to determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.

The dataset used for this project contains loan application information with the following features:

ApplicantIncome: The income of the loan applicant.
CoapplicantIncome: The income of the co-applicant (if any).
LoanAmount: The requested loan amount.
CreditHistory: The credit history of the applicant (1: Good, 0: Bad).
EmploymentStatus: The employment status of the applicant.
PropertyArea: The area where the property is located.
LoanStatus: The target variable indicating whether the loan application was approved (1) or rejected (0).
